    "# Frequently asked questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: *What is the use of a phonetic transliteration of the Hebrew Bible? What can anyone wish beyond the careful, meticulous Masoretic system of consonants, vowels and accents?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the Hebrew Bible may be subject of study in various fields,\n",
    "  where the people involved do not master the Hebrew script;\n",
    "  a phonetic transcription removes a hurdle for them.\n",
    "* in computational linguistics there are many tools that deal with written language in latin alphabets;\n",
    "  even a simple task as getting the consonant-vowel pattern of a word is unnecessarily complicated\n",
    "  when using the Hebrew script.\n",
    "* in phonetics and language learning theory, it is important to represent the sounds without being burdened\n",
    "  by the idiosyncracies of the writing system and the spelling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Q: *But surely, there already exist transliterations of Hebrew? Why not use them?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few pragmatic reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we want to be able to *compute* a transliteration based upon our own data;\n",
    "* we want to gain insight in to what extent the transliteration can be purely rule-based, and to what extent\n",
    "  it depends on lexical information that you just need to know;\n",
    "* we want to make available a well documented transliteration, that can be studied, borrowed and improved by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: *But how **good** is your transliteration?*\n",
    "\n",
    "we do not know, ..., yet. A few remarks though:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we have applied most of the *rules* that we could find in Hebrew grammars;\n",
    "* we have suspended some of the rules for some verb paradigms where it is known that they lead to incorrect results\n",
    "* where the rules did not suffice, we have searched the corpus for other occurrences of the same word, to get clues;\n",
    "* where we knew that clues pointed in the wrong direction, we have applied a list of exceptions (currently a list of only the word בָּתִּֽים (\\*bottˈîm => bāttˈîm) \n",
    "* we have a fair test set with critical cases that all pass\n",
    "* we have a few tables of all cases where the algorithm has made corpus based decisions and lexical decisions\n",
    "* we are open for your corrections: login into [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org), go to a passage with         offending phonetic transliteration, and make a manual note. **Tip:** Give that note the keyword ``phono``, then we\n",
    "  will collect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: *To me, this is not entirely satisfying.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Fair enough. Consider jumping to [Bible Online Learner](http://bibleol.3bmoodle.dk/text/show_text),\n",
    "where they have built in a pretty good transliteration, based on a different method of rule application. It is documented in an article by Nicolai Winther-Nielsen:\n",
    "[Transliteration of Biblical Hebrew for the Role-Lexical Module](http://www.see-j.net/index.php/hiphil/article/view/62) \n",

    "# Overview of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlevel description\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ETCBC transliteration**\n",
    "   Our starting point is the ETCBC full transliteration of the Hebrew Masoretic text.\n",
    "   This transliteration is in 1-1 correspondence with the Masoretic text, including all vowels and accents.\n",
    "1. **Grammar rules** \n",
    "   We have implemented the rules we find in grammars of Hebrew about long and short qamets, mobile and silent schwa,\n",
    "   dagesh, and mater lectionis. \n",
    "   The implementation takes the form of a row of *regular expressions*,\n",
    "   where we transliterate targeted pieces of the original.\n",
    "   These regular expressions are exquisitely formulated, and must be applied in the given order.\n",
    "   *Beware:* Seemingly innocent modifications in these expressions or in the order of application,\n",
    "   may ruin the transcription completely.\n",
    "1. **Qamets puzzles: verbs**\n",
    "   In many verb forms the grammar rules would dictate that a certain qamets is qatan while in fact it is gadol.\n",
    "   In most cases this is caused by the fact that no accent has been marked on the syllable that carries the\n",
    "   qamets in question. There is a limited set of verb paradigms where this occurs.\n",
    "   We detect those and suppress qamets qatan interpretation for them.\n",
    "1. **Qamets puzzles: non-verbs**\n",
    "   There are quite a few non-verb occurrences where the accent pattern of a word invites a qamets to become\n",
    "   qatan, that is, by the grammar rules. \n",
    "   Yet, other occurrences of the same lexeme have other accent patterns, and\n",
    "   lead to a gadol interpretation of the same qamets. \n",
    "   In this case we count the unique cases in favour of gadol versus qatan, and let the majority decide for all \n",
    "   occurrences. In cases where we know that the majority votes wrong, we have intervened.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Qamets work hypothesis\n",
    "Note, that in the the *non-verb qamets puzzles* we have tacitly made the assumption that qamets qatan and gadol are not phonological variants of each other.\n",
    "In other words, it never occurs that a qamets gadol becomes shortened into a qamets qatan.\n",
    "From the grammar rules it follows that short versions of the qamets can only be\n",
    "\n",
    "* patah\n",
    "* schwa\n",
    "* composite schwa with patah\n",
    "\n",
    "and never\n",
    "\n",
    "* qamets qatan\n",
    "* composite schwa with qamets\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether this hypothesis is right, is not my competence. \n",
    "We just use it as a working hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical information\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is not a pure method, in the sense that it works only with the information given in the source string.\n",
    "We *cheat*, i.e. we use morphological information from the ETCBC database to \n",
    "steer us into the right directorion. To this end, the input of the `phono()` is always a\n",
    "LAF node, from which we can get all information we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, it is a sequence of nodes.\n",
    "This sequence is meant to correspond to a sequence of monads, that is written adjacently\n",
    "(no space between, no maqef between).\n",
    "From these nodes we can look up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the ETCBC transliteration\n",
    "* the qere (if there is a discrepancy between ketiv and qere)\n",
    "* additional lexical information (taken from the last node)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combined words\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `phono()` to transliterate multiple words at the same time, but you can also do individual words,\n",
    "even if in Hebrew they are written together.\n",
    "However, it is better to feed combined words to `phono()` in one go, because the prefix word may influence the transliteration of the postfix word. Think of the article followed by word starting with a BGDKPT letter.\n",
    "The dagesh in the BGDKPT is interpreted as a lene, if the word stands on its own, but as a forte if it is combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it not not advised to feed longer strings to `phono()`, because when phono retrieves lexical information, it uses the information of the last node that matches a word in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accents\n",
    "\n",
    "We determine \"primary\" and \"secundary\" stress in our transliteration, but this must not be taken in a phonetic sense.\n",
    "Every syllable that carries an accent pointing will get a primary stress mark.\n",
    "However, a few specific accent pointings are not deemed to produce an an accent, and an other group of accents\n",
    "is deemed to produce only a secondary accent.\n",
    "The last syllable of a word also gets a secundary accent by default.\n",
    "We have not yet tried to be more precise in this, so *segolates* do not get the treatment they deserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main rationale for accents is that they prevent a qamets to be read as qatan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made a careful selection of UNICODE symbols to represent Hebrew sounds.\n",
    "Sometimes we follow the phonetic usage of the symbols, sometimes we follow wide spread custom.\n",
    "The actual mapping can be plugged in quite easily, \n",
    "and the intermediate stages in the transformation do not use these final symbols,\n",
    "so the algorithm can be easily adapted to other choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consonants\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided it is not part of a long vowel, we write yod as `y`,\n",
    "whilst `j` would be more in line with the phonetic alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, we write `ו` as w, if it is not part of a long vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the `BGDKPT` letters,\n",
    "it would have been attractive to use the letters `b g d k p t` without \n",
    "diacritic for the plosive variants, and with a suitable diacritic for the fricative variants.\n",
    "Alas, the UNICODE table does not offer such a suitable diacritic that is available for all these particular 6 letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we use `b g d k p t` for the plosives, but for the fricatives we use `v ḡ ḏ ḵ f ṯ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the *emphatic* consonants ט and ח and צ we\n",
    "represent them with a under dot: `ṭ ḥ ṣ`.\n",
    "ק is just `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "א and ע translate to translate to `ʕ` and `ʔ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "שׁ and שׂ translate to `š` and `ś`.\n",
    "ס is just `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When א and ה are mater lectionis, they are left out. A ה with mappiq becomes just `h`,\n",
    "like every ה which is not a mater lectionis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not mark the deviant final forms of the consonants ך and ם and ן and ף and ץ, assuming that\n",
    "this is just a scriptural peculiarity, with no effect on the actual sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining consonants go as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr><td>ל</td><td>l</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>מ</td><td>m</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>נ</td><td>n</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>ר</td><td>r</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>ז</td><td>z</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vowels\n",
    "\n",
    "The short vowels (patah, segol, hireq) are just `a e i` and qibbuts is just `u`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the *furtive* patah is a `ₐ` in front of its consonant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long vowels without yod or waw (qamets gadol, tsere, holam) have an over bar `ā ē ō`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex vowels (tsere or hireq plus yod, holam plus waw, waw with dagesh) have a circumflex `ê î ô û`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A segol followed by yod becomes `eʸ`\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite schwas (patah, segol, qamets) are written as superscripts `ᵃ ᵉ ᵒ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple schwa is left out if silent, and otherwise it becomes `ᵊ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accent\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary and secundary stress are marked as `ˈ ˌ` and are placed *in front of the vowel they occur with*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sof-pasuq ׃ becomes `.`. \n",
    "If it is followed by ס (setumah) or ף (petuhah) or  ̇׆ (nun-hafuka), these extra symbols are omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maqef ־ (between words) becomes `-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If words are juxtaposed without space in the Hebrew, they are also juxtaposed without space in the phonetic\n",
    "transliteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tetragrammaton\n",
    "\n",
    "The tetragrammaton is transliterated with the vowels it is encountered with, but the whole is put between \n",
    "square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ketiv-qere\n",
    "\n",
    "We base the phonetics on the (vocalized) qere, if a qere is present.\n",
    "The ketiv is then ignored. We precede each such word by a `*` to indicate that the qere\n",
    "is deviant from the ketiv. Using the data view it is possible to see what the ketiv is. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning up\n",
    "\n",
    "We leave the accents and the schwas in the end product of the `phono()` function,\n",
    "despite the fact that the accents, as they appear, do not have consistent phonetic significance.\n",
    "And it can be argued that every schwa is silent.\n",
    "If you do not care for schwas and accents, it is easy to remove them.\n",
    "Also, if you find the results in separating the qamets into qatan and gadol unsatisfying or irrelevant, you can\n",
    "just replace them both bij a single symbol, such as `å`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite a bit of code is dedicated to count special cases, to test, and to produce neat tables with interesting forms.\n",
    "It is also possible to call the `phono()` function in debug mode, which will write to a text file all stages in the\n",
    "transliteration from etcbc orginal into the phonetic result."

    "The ``phono()`` function that we will define (far) below, performs an ordered sequence of transformations.\n",

    "and some parts of those expressions occur over and over again, e.g. subpatterns for *vowel* and *consonant*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the shortcuts that we are going to use in the regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details of the matching process\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when a pattern matches a string, the string is consumed: the parts of the pattern that match\n",
    "consume corresponding stretches of the string.\n",
    "However, in many cases a pattern specifies specific contexts in which a match should be found.\n",
    "In those cases we do not want that the context parts of the pattern are responsible for string\n",
    "consumption, because in those parts there could be another relevangt match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular expression there is a solution for that: look-ahead and look-behind assertions and we use them frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "``(?<=`` *before_pattern* ``)`` *pattern* ``(?=`` *behind-pattern* ``)``\n",
    "\n",
    "A match of this pattern in a string is a portion of a string that matches *pattern*, provided that\n",
    "portion is preceded by *before_pattern* and followed by *behind* pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a match, and new matches must be searched for, the search will start right after *pattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the above *positive* look-ahead and look-behind assertions, there are also *negative* variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "``(?<!`` *before_pattern* ``)`` *pattern* ``(?!`` *behind-pattern* ``)``\n",

    "For example, vowels can be simple or complex, and hence have variable length.\n",
    "If we want to specify a consonant, provided it is preceded by a vowel, we have to be careful.\n",
