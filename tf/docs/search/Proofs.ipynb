    "We have a dataset which is a graph consisting of text nodes and text edges, in short, nodes and edges.\n",
    "Nodes are textual objects, edges are relations between them.\n",
    "\n",

    "The set of all text nodes of a\n",

    "The fleece of a query node, is the fleece of the node type that is associated with that query\n",

    "\n",
    "If we filter the fleece of a node by some process, we call the result set a *yarn*\n",
    "of that query node.\n",

    "The *thick* yarn of a query node consists of the fleece of the query node,\n",
    "filtered by the features dict of the query node.\n",

    "## Spinning and proper yarns\n",
    "If we have an edge $e_j = (R_j, q_f, q_t)$ and if we have yarns $y_f, y_t$ for\n",
    "$q_f$, $q_t$, then we *turn* the edge $e_j$ \n",

    "\n",
    "The result of this spinning are two new yarns, $z_f, z_t$, obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we iterate through the text nodes $s$ in yarn $y_i$:\n",
    "  * we compute the set of text nodes $u$ in $y_j$ such that $sRu$ holds;\n",

    "    * add the $s$ text node to $z_i$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Otherwise we do not add nodes to $z_i$ nor to $z_j$.\n",

    "So spinning means thinning out the yarns of two query nodes that are connected to a\n",
    "query edge, in such a way, that afterwards the relationship that is associated\n",
    "with the edge, can be realized for every text node in both yarns.\n",
    "In other words: after spinning, every text node in a yarn involved, has at least one\n",
    "counterpart text node in the other yarn such that both are in relationship which each other.\n",
    "That is, the relationship belonging to the edge.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A *proper yarn* of a query node is either its *principal yarn* or any yarn that results from\n",

    "\n",
    "If this is the case, we call text node $s_i$ a *stitch* for query node $q_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A result can be seen as a stitching together of the principal yarns of the query nodes,\n",
    "in such a way, that all constraints specified by the query edges are satisfied.\n",
    "The stitches are those nodes in the text, one for each yarn, that together constitute\n",
    "a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overspun and underspun yards\n",
    "\n",
    "If a yarn of a query node has become so thin, that it fails to contain stitches of\n",

    "\n",
    "**if, after some spinning, all edges are up-to-date, then all yarns are fully spun.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "Because the yarns are never overspun by lemma 2,\n",
    "we must prove that when all edges are up-to-date,\n",
    "none of the yarns are *underspun*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are in the situation that all edges are up-to-date.\n",
    "Suppose that in this situation there is an underspun yarn $y_i$, associated\n",
    "with query node $q_i$.\n",
    "That means that $y_i$ contains a text node $s$ that does not belong to any final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a closer look at how $q_i$ lies hooked up in the query graph.\n",
    "Because the query is a connected component, we have only these possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case a: $q_i$ does not belong to an edge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $q_i$ must the only node, because if there were other nodes,\n",
    "there would have been bridges from $q_i$ to those other nodes, and hence\n",
    "$q_i$ would be involved in edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the query is just one node without edges, hence $y_i$ is the primary yarn,\n",
    "and hence all nodes in it are results. So this $s$ cannot exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case b: $q_i$ has an out-going edge or an incoming edge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $q_i$-outgoing edges $(R_j, q_i, q_t)$ it holds that there\n",
    "is a $u$ in the yarn $y_t$ of $q_t$ such that $sR_ju$.\n",
    "This is because all edges are up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like wise, for all $q_i$-incoming edges $(R_k, q_f, q_i)$ it holds that\n",
    "there is a $u$ in the yarn $y_f$ of $q_f$ such that $uR_ks$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all $u$s found in this way belonged to the result, then $s$ would also belong\n",
    "to the result, because all its edge constraints would be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if, as we assumed, $s$ is not in the result, then at least one of those $u$s\n",
    "does not belong to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can repeat the same argument for this $u$, and find a $v$ that does not belong\n",
    "to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are finitely many nodes, we find a cycle $s_1, ... , s_k$ of text\n",
    "nodes in yarns $y_1, ... , y_k$ that do not belong to the result.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that we have 999,999 possibilities for $w_2$, of which only the first 10 are part of\n",
    "a result. All others are not in the same sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we try out all these $w_2$s, we get 10 results fairly quickly, and then 999,990 spurious tries, before we try a new node in the yarn of $Word1$ and get new results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time we have collected all results,\n",
    "we have visited a million times on average half a million words, or\n",

    "\n",
    "We could have done it in an other way: after picking $w_1$ from the yarn of $Word1$,\n",
    "we pick a sentence $s_1$ from the yarn of *Sentence* (only one possibility), and from\n",
    "there we pick a $w_2$ from the yarn of $Word2$ such that $w_2$ is in $s_1$ (only 10 possibilities). Of those 10 possibilities, one will be rejected, (where $w_2 = w_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we move to the next $w_1$ in the yarn of $Word1$, which is the second word in the same sentence, pick the same $s_1$ in the sentence yarn, pick the same words in the $Word2$\n",
    "yarn, reject 2 of them, and deliver 8 results.\n",
    "And so on.\n",
