# Install

## If you have already Python on your machine

Make sure you have at least Python 3.9.0

Recommended: install JupyterLab:
fire up a terminal (= command prompt) and say

``` sh
pip install jupyterlab
```

To get text-fabric, you can either fire up a terminal and say:

``` sh
pip install text-fabric
```

or fire up a Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter lab`)

and in a cell say

``` sh
!pip install text-fabric
```

Now restart this notebook by clicking the circular arrow in the toolbar:

![restart](../images/restartkernel.png).

## If you do not have Python

The fastest way to set up everything you need to use TF is by installing the
JupyterLab Desktop application.

This installs both JupyterLab and Python in one go,
as a desktop application running under  MacOS, Linux or Windows.

The Jupyter Desktop App can be downloaded from
[JupyterLab-desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop),
choose the one that fits your system.

After downloading, go to your downloads folder and install the application in the way
you are used to, but notice the following:

**on macos**: right-click the `.pkg` file, answer the dialog box with `OK`. 

**on all platforms**: install for the current user, not for all users, otherwise
you run into problems later on.

*macos*: click "Change install location" and set it to "Install for me only"

*linux*: after installation, run the following command from a terminal
where `username` should be changed
to your username on the system:

``` sh
sudo chown -R username:username /opt/JupyterLab
```

*windows*: no extra instructions.
Two installers will be launched, let them work with the same default
location for installation.

### Work with TF

In a notebook, put this *incantation* in a cell and run it:

``` python
from tf.app import use
```

And in a next cell, load the data of some corpus, e.g. `annotation/banks`.


``` python
A = use("annotation/banks")
```

The first time you do this you will see that the data is being downloaded and
prepared for its first use.
If you do this a second time, the data is already on your computer in
pre-processed form, and TF will see that data and load it quickly.

From here you can use a
[tutorial](https://nbviewer.org/github/annotation/banks/blob/master/tutorial/use.ipynb).

More extensive tutorials are available for other corpora, see `tf.about.corpora`.

### TF browser

You can also work with TF outside any programming context, just in the browser.

In a terminal, say

``` sh
tf annotation/banks
```

Or, in a notebook cell, say

``` sh
!tf annotation/banks
```

Wait a few seconds and you see a new window in your browser
with an interface to submit queries to the corpus.

#### Note for Linux users

*   On Ubuntu the `tf` script ends up in your `~/.local/bin` directory,
    but this is not on your PATH.
*   You need to execute your `.profile` file first by:

``` sh
source ~/.profile
```

You need to do this every time when you open a new terminal and
want to run TF.
If you get tired of this, you can add this to your `.bashrc` file:

``` sh
PATH="~/.local/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
```
