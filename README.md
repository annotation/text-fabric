A corpus of ancient texts and (linguistic) annotations represents a large body of knowledge.
Text-Fabric makes that knowledge accessible to programmers and non-programmers.

Text-Fabric is machinery for processing such corpora as annotated graphs.
It treats corpora and annotations as data, much like big tables, but without
loosing the rich structure of text, such as embedding and multiple representations.
It deals with text in a state where all markup is gone, but where the complete logical
structure still sits in the data.

All about Text-Fabric is in the
[docs](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf).

See also
[text-fabric-factory](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric-factory)
for programs to convert other formats to TF.
