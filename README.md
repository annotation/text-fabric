If you want to cite snippets of the code of this repository, the Software Archive
offers an easy and elegant way to do so.
As an example, here I quote the 
[*stitching* algorithm](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:cnt:6169c074089ddc8a0e048cb67e1fec57857ef54d;lines=3224-3270/),
by means of which Text-Fabric Search collects the solutions of a
[search template](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/Use/Search/).
The quote refers directly to specific lines of code, deeply buried in
a Python file within a particular version of Text-Fabric.**
